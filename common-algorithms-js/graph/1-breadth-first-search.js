 *   A JavaScript module which performs a breadth first search on a graph using the graph's adjacency matrix as input to determine whether or not the graph is connected.  If a connected graph's adjacency matrix is input, true is returned.  If a disconnected graph's adjacency matrix is input, false is returned.
